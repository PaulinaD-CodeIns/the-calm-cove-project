## Visual Design

The design theme for The Calm Cove was intentionally crafted to reflect the core values of grounding, balance, and calmness — central concepts in wellness and yoga. The choice of colors and overall aesthetic was carefully selected to evoke feelings of tranquility, connection to nature, and inner peace.

**Color Palette**:

The colors used in the design were chosen to mirror the neutral, earthy tones of the natural world. By incorporating shades that you would find in the earth, plants, and nature, the design promotes a sense of calm and serenity:

- Dark Olive Green (#3E4E38): This rich, earthy green symbolizes stability and grounding. It reflects the solid, dependable foundation of the earth and serves to create a calm, anchored environment for the user. Green is also a color associated with nature, renewal, and healing, making it a perfect fit for a wellness-oriented brand.
- Soft Sage Green (#A1C9A5): This light, muted green represents balance and harmony. It evokes feelings of relaxation and emotional peace, encouraging the viewer to feel at ease and welcomed.
- Off-White (#F4F1E1) and White (#FFFFFF): These neutral tones provide a clean and open space, allowing the other colors to breathe and preventing the design from feeling too busy or overwhelming. White is often associated with purity, simplicity, and clarity, fostering a sense of peace and focus. It also enhances readability, ensuring that all the information on the website is easy to access and absorb.

**Design Elements and Layout:**

The layout was designed to flow naturally and intuitively, with the content structured to guide the user effortlessly through the website. This reflects the organic nature of wellness — simple, yet intentional design that aligns with natural movements and rhythms. The flexible grid system ensures that elements are aligned symmetrically, while also adapting fluidly to various screen sizes.

The rounded corners on images and buttons echo the soft, organic shapes of nature, avoiding harsh angles or rigid lines that might disrupt the calming vibe.
The white space between sections allows for mental breathing room, creating a sense of spaciousness and tranquility, akin to the openness found in a peaceful natural setting. This is how the deployed version of this website has turned out visually:

 ![Deploy4](./assets/readme.md-images/Deploy4.png)
 ![Deploy5](./assets/readme.md-images/Deploy5.png)

There is room for improvements especially around the 'What We Offer' section. This section of the CSS code would need extra time with to make sure the flexbox method is used more effectively to better the placement of the elements. At the moment the different types of classes on offer are in a list that has inconsistent font size and placement in relation to other elements in it's section. 

**Text and Typography:**

The use of Arial for the font reflects a modern, simple, and clean design, ensuring that content is accessible without distraction. The font choice is unobtrusive, aligning with the idea of a space that promotes focus and reflection.

**Logo:**

The Calm Cove logo was created using Canva, utilizing a pre-generated template that matched the brand's tranquil and organic theme. The white color was chosen for its simplicity and to align with the clean, minimalist design of the website.

The logo's subtle design ensures it doesn’t overwhelm users while maintaining brand recognition. This choice complements the white header, creating a cohesive, peaceful aesthetic that enhances the user experience without distraction.

**Images:**

Website's imagery plays a crucial role in reinforcing the natural, grounding atmosphere of the website. The images were carefully selected to evoke a sense of warmth, comfort, and calm, immersing users in the peaceful world of The Calm Cove.

- Welcome Image: The welcoming image is intentionally chosen to convey a positive, warm, and inviting atmosphere. The earthy tones in the image — with its soft, natural hues — enhance the calming effect and make visitors feel at ease. The figure of the woman with open arms symbolically invites visitors to embrace the site, creating a sense of welcome and belonging. This image is designed to make users feel as though they are being embraced into the community, reflecting the open-hearted nature of the wellness journey offered by the brand.

## Testing

- **Validation**:

  - HTML has been validated with the W3C HTML5 Validator. There was 1 error message for HTML code to remove the "alt" tag from the iframe Google Maps link. Once this was removed, the HTML validator showed there was no errors left.
  ![HTMLError](./assets/readme.md-images/HTMLError.png)
  ![HTMLCorrect](./assets/readme.md-images/HTMLCorrect.png)

  - CSS has been successfully validated with the W3C CSS Validator. Links checked with https://validator.w3.org/checklink (W3C Link Checker).
  ![CSSCorrect](./assets/readme.md-images/CSSCorrect.png)


- **Testing Platforms**:

  - The project was mainly tested using the Chrome Browsers Dev Tools feature which displayed mostly everything as expected, across different devices to test responsiveness.
  - Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was not able to personally test the project across a wider range of devices. This is an area I would suggest for improvement in the future, as thorough cross-device testing would help ensure a more seamless experience for users on various platforms.
  - I was, however, able to test this project’s functionality across different browsers such as Firefox, Safari and Edge using LambdaTest. (Source: https://app.lambdatest.com/console/realtime/browser/desktop.) This test confirmed the successful functionality of this project across all these browsers with no bugs or compromises in fast performance.

-  **Issues Found:**

The design is largely responsive and has been tested across a range of devices, including small phones, medium devices, tablets, and desktops. In most cases, the responsive design functions as expected. However, there are a couple of issues on specific phones. On devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, the timetable section overflows beyond its container, and for devices such as the Samsung Z Fold 5, the margin on the right side appears misaligned and out of proportion. These issues are relatively minor in the grand scheme of the design but would require further refinement. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to resolve this issue within the project timeline, but it remains a top-task for future development.

## Credits

1. **Content Generator:** Initially, the content for the website was based on a combination of materials and inspiration gathered from Robyn's Yoga Studio in Bath. The original content, which can be found at Robyn's Yoga Studio, served as a starting point, providing real-life descriptions and information relevant to the yoga center's offerings and philosophy. However, to tailor the content to The Calm Cove and its unique identity, several sections were revised and enhanced. To align the content with The Calm Cove's brand voice and avoid copyright infringement, I used ChatGPT 4.0 for AI-assisted content generation. This tool helped refine the language, clarify messaging, and maintain a calming, welcoming tone that reflects the wellness-centered ethos of the studio, ensuring consistency, clarity, and accessibility throughout the site. Sources: https://chatgpt.com/ and https://www.robynsyoga.co.uk/.

2. **Background Image:** To source the mediation pose photo I have used Pexels. The source of the welcome image has not been recorded anywhere and when trying to look for it using Google Images search there is no exact matches to where this image has come from. Instead, the search shows other websites where this image has been used so it is very possible that I have found this photo and took a screenshot of it from the third party website. This site source is also unknown. 

3. **README.md Structure:** The structure of this README document follows a model example shared by my mentor. The instructions for GitHub deployment are directly referenced from this source. Source:https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/horizon-photo/blob/main/README.md#mobile-testing.
