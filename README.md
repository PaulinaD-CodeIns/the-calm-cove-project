Content: 
Content for this page has been sourced from Robyns Yoga website: [https://www.robynsyoga.co.uk/class-info.html]. Content is not my own. 

Footer:
The format of the footer has been sourced from the Love Running project.

Testing and Deployment:
Deployment has been a success. Everything has matched with the server preview I had used when working on GitHub.

Testing has shown a few errors. To see those in details, please see the [assets/readme.md-images]. In the end, once the meta tags format and loose tags were tidied up, the validator has shown there was no errors. The CSS has had no errors either. 

User Experience:
Although the project has no been completed, the visual structure has been designed using Canva tool online. Please see this pathway again [assets/readme.md-images] to view the design, even though I am sure you are intrested in the code more. 










PS. Sincereset apologies, this is definetely not the best I can do.
