## Visual Design

The design theme for The Calm Cove was intentionally crafted to reflect the core values of grounding, balance, and calmness — central concepts in wellness and yoga. The choice of colors and overall aesthetic was carefully selected to evoke feelings of tranquility, connection to nature, and inner peace.

**Color Palette**:

The colors used in the design were chosen to mirror the neutral, earthy tones of the natural world. By incorporating shades that you would find in the earth, plants, and nature, the design promotes a sense of calm and serenity:

- Dark Olive Green (#3E4E38): This rich, earthy green symbolizes stability and grounding. It reflects the solid, dependable foundation of the earth and serves to create a calm, anchored environment for the user. Green is also a color associated with nature, renewal, and healing, making it a perfect fit for a wellness-oriented brand.
- Soft Sage Green (#A1C9A5): This light, muted green represents balance and harmony. It evokes feelings of relaxation and emotional peace, encouraging the viewer to feel at ease and welcomed.
- Off-White (#F4F1E1) and White (#FFFFFF): These neutral tones provide a clean and open space, allowing the other colors to breathe and preventing the design from feeling too busy or overwhelming. White is often associated with purity, simplicity, and clarity, fostering a sense of peace and focus. It also enhances readability, ensuring that all the information on the website is easy to access and absorb.

**Design Elements and Layout:**

The layout was designed to flow naturally and intuitively, with the content structured to guide the user effortlessly through the website. This reflects the organic nature of wellness — simple, yet intentional design that aligns with natural movements and rhythms. The flexible grid system ensures that elements are aligned symmetrically, while also adapting fluidly to various screen sizes. This responsiveness symbolizes balance — the design remains harmonious and user-friendly, no matter the device.

The rounded corners on images and buttons echo the soft, organic shapes of nature, avoiding harsh angles or rigid lines that might disrupt the calming vibe.
The white space between sections allows for mental breathing room, creating a sense of spaciousness and tranquility, akin to the openness found in a peaceful natural setting.

**Text and Typography:**

The use of Arial for the font reflects a modern, simple, and clean design, ensuring that content is accessible without distraction. The font choice is unobtrusive, aligning with the idea of a space that promotes focus and reflection.

**Images:**

Website's imagery plays a crucial role in reinforcing the natural, grounding atmosphere of the website. The images were carefully selected to evoke a sense of warmth, comfort, and calm, immersing users in the peaceful world of The Calm Cove.

- Welcome Image: The welcoming image is intentionally chosen to convey a positive, warm, and inviting atmosphere. The earthy tones in the image — with its soft, natural hues — enhance the calming effect and make visitors feel at ease. The figure of the woman with open arms symbolically invites visitors to embrace the site, creating a sense of welcome and belonging. This image is designed to make users feel as though they are being embraced into the community, reflecting the open-hearted nature of the wellness journey offered by the brand.

- Meditation Pose Image: The meditation pose photo carries the same organic tones and peaceful vibe. It includes candles and incense burning in the lower left corner, which visually evokes a feeling of warmth, coziness, and serenity. This imagery contributes to the sense of tranquility and calmness that the brand aims to create, reinforcing the theme of wellness, mindfulness, and inner peace.

## Credits

1. **Content Generator:** Initially, the content for the website was based on a combination of materials and inspiration gathered from Robyn's Yoga Studio in Bath. The original content, which can be found at Robyn's Yoga Studio, served as a starting point, providing real-life descriptions and information relevant to the yoga center's offerings and philosophy. However, to tailor the content to The Calm Cove and its unique identity, several sections were revised and enhanced. To align the content with The Calm Cove's brand voice and avoid copyright infringement, I used ChatGPT 4.0 for AI-assisted content generation. This tool helped refine the language, clarify messaging, and maintain a calming, welcoming tone that reflects the wellness-centered ethos of the studio, ensuring consistency, clarity, and accessibility throughout the site. Sources: https://chatgpt.com/ and https://www.robynsyoga.co.uk/.

2. **Background Image:** To source the mediation pose photo I have used Pexels. The source of the welcome image has not been recorded anywhere and when trying to look for it using Google Images search there is no exact matches to where this image has come from. Instead, the search shows other websites where this image has been used so it is very possible that I have found this photo and took a screenshot of it from the third party website. This site source is also unknown. 

3. **README.md Structure:** The structure of this README document follows a model example shared by my mentor. The instructions for GitHub deployment are directly referenced from this source. Source:https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/horizon-photo/blob/main/README.md#mobile-testing.
