## Credits

1. **Content Generator:** Initially, the content for the website was based on a combination of materials and inspiration gathered from Robyn's Yoga Studio in Bath. The original content, which can be found at Robyn's Yoga Studio, served as a starting point, providing real-life descriptions and information relevant to the yoga center's offerings and philosophy. However, to tailor the content to The Calm Cove and its unique identity, several sections were revised and enhanced. To align the content with The Calm Cove's brand voice and avoid copyright infringement, I used ChatGPT 4.0 for AI-assisted content generation. This tool helped refine the language, clarify messaging, and maintain a calming, welcoming tone that reflects the wellness-centered ethos of the studio, ensuring consistency, clarity, and accessibility throughout the site. Sources: https://chatgpt.com/ and https://www.robynsyoga.co.uk/.

2. **Background Image:** To source the mediation pose photo I have used Pexels. The source of the welcome image has not been recorded anywhere and when trying to look for it using Google Images search there is no exact matches to where this image has come from. Instead, the search shows other websites where this image has been used so it is very possible that I have found this photo and took a screenshot of it from the third party website. This site source is also unknown. 

3. **README.md Structure:** The structure of this README document follows a model example shared by my mentor. The instructions for GitHub deployment are directly referenced from this source. Source:https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/horizon-photo/blob/main/README.md#mobile-testing.
