            <h3>What we offer</h3>
            <p>To help you find your inner zen we currently offer 3 types of yoga that will support you on your journey
                of personal development with energy healing, breathwork and holistic freeing movement. We offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beginners Yoga - New to yoga and want to try a relaxing, spiritual workout? Or has it just been a
                    little while? This, is a great class to test the waters and get into the swing
                    of things either for the first time, or back again.
                </li>
                <li>The Restorative Yoga - Indulge in all the subtleties yoga has to offer and use ALL the props (no
                    need to bring your own, we got you covered). Allow your body to melt into passive poses that wash
                    away stress and strains. </li>
                <li>Yoga Flow - A flowing sequence of asana's working with breath. Each class will be unique, teachers are
                    encouraged to teach authentically and creatively.</li>
            </ul>
